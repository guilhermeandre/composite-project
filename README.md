# Composite Project 

## This is a website redesign and re-branding project for the Web Design and Development course. 

## Goals:
### Redesign the branding 
### Make the website more accesible. 

### LowFidelity wireframes: desktop and mobile version 
#### I started thinking about the project and designed the low-fidelity wireframes to place the items and display them as I wanted.

### Highfidelity wireframes: desktop and mobile version 
#### Then I chose the colours and the visual elements.

### HTML and CSS development: 
#### As suggested, I started developing the HTML file only after deciding my elements and their attributes. After adding all the elements to the HTML file I started styling the page itself. 
## CSS: Mobile first 
#### I started developing the mobile (small screen) version with responsive elements resizing.
