# Composite Project 

## This is a website redesign and re-branding project for the Web Design and Development course. 

## Goals:
### Redesign the branding.
### Make the website accessible.

## Process:
#### Low-fidelity wireframes: desktop and mobile version 
##### I started thinking about the project and designed the low-fidelity wireframes to place the items and display them as I wanted.

#### HTML and CSS development: 
##### As suggested, I started developing the HTML file only after deciding my elements and their attributes. After adding all the elements to the HTML file I started styling the page itself. 
#### CSS: Mobile first 
##### I started developing the mobile (small screen) version with responsive elements resizing. After adjusting correctly this environment (320px), I started making arrangements for the 640px & 1280px versions. Elements such as flex became grids, with consistent aligned contents to be displayed better. 

#### This redesign was conceived to make the navigation more intuitive and simple, with clean menus and boxes, the purpose is to provide a delightful experience while searching for a hotel, car or trip destination.
